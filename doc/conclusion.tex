\section*{Performances}

With this project we can now understand the optimization structures, because in this project, slowness is the main issue. In a plateform which compute this much and contain a lot of entities to manage, it is essential to have an optimized plateform.

\section*{Critical analysis}

We completed our main objectives. We have create an environment including stages, obstacles, an entry gate, stands and toilets, in which several types of agents can evolve. Each agent has a specific behaviour during the simulation. Additionally the interactions between agents and stands are working pretty well and if we let simulation running we can really observe crowd movements. Finally, when the user set the bomb, each agent reaction changes end everyone tries to reach the gate avoiding the bomb.\\

With a little more time we could have improved the bomb explosion, the role of bodyguard and medics, and the collision avoidance between agents and between agents and obstacles.
