The project globally consists in simulating people's actions during one day of
festival. Our goals can be listed as follows.\\

\begin{itemize}
	\item Model the site environment: stages, stands of different kind, 
	bathrooms, trees, barriers, exit/entrance.
	\item Simulate crowd movements among stands and stages during the day, 
	according to each people particular need.
